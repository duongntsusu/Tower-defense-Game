# Tower-defense-Game
This project is an assignment from a pre-college summer program that I participated in the summer after my junior year at high school. 
Some of the program's main feature:
+ Inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies
+ Using Object-oriented Programming paradigms like Class and Inheritance to define attributes and behaviors for the game's characters and settings
+  Employing core game building concepts
Note: To start the graphical version of the game, run python3 gui.py
After staring the graphical version, the game is usually available at http://127.0.0.1:31415/.
